        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "  > This paper explores ways to make data cleaning easy and effective.  It focuses on data tidying as a way to make data easy to manipulate, model, model and visualize by adhering to specific structures.  Following such a framework allows the development of tools for data analysis, as seen in a case study that is not burdened by data manipulation tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "  >  The \"tidy data standard\" has the primary goal of making it easier to clean and explore data through having a standard method to organize data values within a data set.  Wickham's experiences with oddly constructed data sets inspired the creation of packages to reshape data, there was no underlying framework to describe the intuition behind the organization\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "  >The first sentence draws a comparison between families and datasets. The main purpose of this statement is to show that all 'tidy' datasets have the same general framework and properties, while the category of 'messy' datasets has no common structure or underlying framework that connects them. Each 'messy' dataset is structured in a way that may only benefit the creator, and changing it may require intensive effort. The second sentence touches on the fact that it is challenging to place a clear-cut definition on terms, since datasets vary widely in the information they gather and how they are displayed. Making precise definitions about variables and observations is often about which will be the most efficient and beneficial for the data scientist\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Values are defined as the items that make up a dataset, either quantitative measurements (numbers), or qualitative descriptions (strings).  Variables are used to store values that all refer to the same property or attribute. Observations are collections of values that measure or describe the observation.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Tidy Data is composed of 3 main concepts: each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "  > The five most common problems with messy datasets are:Column headers are values and not variable names, multiple variables being stored in one column, having variables stored in both rows and columns, storing multiple types of observational units in the same table, and storing a single observational unit in multiple tables. The data in table 4 are messy because the columns are not actual variables of the data set; rather just specific ranges that the overall \"income\" variable can have. Melting a dataset refers to the process of stacking the data set by turning columns into rows to store the data in a different way\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Table 11 is organized in a similar way to table 4, where the column names are values that can all be stored under a single \"date\" variable.  This data can be melted, the results of which can be seen in table 12b, which also tidies up the element variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "\n",
        "  > The \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with tidy data is that if tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools are permanently linked to tidy data.  Wickham hopes that the tidy data framework is not the final solution, and that others build upon it to make even better strategies and tools."
